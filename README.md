### Claquette AI üé¨

Claquette AI is a Spring Boot backend application for an AI-powered platform that helps users (companies) generate film and series projects using artificial intelligence. The system covers subscription management, AI-driven content generation, payment integration, email notifications, and dashboards. Here's a breakdown of the main modules:

---

### üîê Authentication & Security

- **JwtUtil**: Handles JWT token generation and validation for secure operations (like password reset). Tokens expire in 15 minutes and are used for password reset links.
- **MyUserDetailsService**: Integrates with Spring Security to load users by email. Throws ApiException if the email is not found.

---

### üë§ User & Company Management

- **WatheqService**: Integrates with Saudi Arabia's Watheq API to validate commercial registration numbers before allowing company registration. If registration is valid and active, a new User and Company are created. Passwords are hashed with BCrypt. A verification code is generated and sent to the user's email.
- **VerificationService**: Manages 6-digit verification codes for account activation. Codes expire after 10 minutes and are stored in memory (ConcurrentHashMap).
- **VerificationEmailService**: Sends account verification emails and contact emails (contact us form). Emails are HTML styled with RTL (Arabic) and branding.
- **PasswordResetService**: Sends password reset links with JWT tokens. Email includes styled HTML with a reset button.

---

### üìΩ Projects, Films, and Episodes

- **ProjectService**: CRUD operations for projects (FILM or SERIES). Projects are linked to a Company. Each project has metadata (budget, genre, audience, location, etc.). Handles poster generation via AI or manual upload. Provides dashboard statistics (projects count, budget, characters, breakdowns by genre, type, year, etc.).
- **EpisodeService**: Generates series episodes with scenes using AI. Uses PromptBuilderService to build prompts with project + character data. Calls AiClientService to generate JSON output. Validates character consistency across episodes and scenes. Saves episodes in the DB and allows retrieval.
- **FilmService**: Similar to EpisodeService but for films. Ensures projects are FILM type. Validates characters exist before generation. Generates AI-powered films with consistent characters and structured scenes. Allows retrieving film and its scenes.
- **SceneService**: Manages scenes inside films/episodes. Retrieves scenes for a project (different logic for FILM vs SERIES). Updates scene dialogue. Counts character-scene associations.

---

### üí≥ Payments & Subscriptions

- **CompanySubscriptionService**: Manages subscriptions for companies. Plans: FREE (0 SAR, status = FREE_PLAN) and ADVANCED (1999.99 SAR/month). Handles adding subscriptions, renewals, activations/cancellations, status checks (EXPIRED, ACTIVE, PENDING), and subscription dashboard (current plan, history, alerts, statistics). Uses @Scheduled task to check expired subscriptions every minute.
- **PaymentService**: Integrates with Moyasar API for payments. Processes card payments. Saves payment details (transactionId, status, etc.). Confirms subscription once payment status = paid. Sends invoice PDF by email upon success.
- **PdfService & PdfMailService**: Generate PDF invoices (via OpenHTMLToPDF + Thymeleaf) and send them via email. Styled invoice with subscription details. Email includes both a thank-you message and the attached PDF invoice.

---

### ü§ñ AI Integration

- **AiClientService**: Primary service to call OpenAI or other LLM API to generate JSON for episodes (structured with scenes and characters), films (full structure with scenes), and posters (AI image generation).
- **JsonExtractor**: Parses AI JSON responses into entities (Episode, Film, Scene, etc.).
- **PromptBuilderService**: Builds dynamic AI prompts based on project descriptions, episode numbers, and characters.

---

### üìä Dashboards

- **Project Dashboard** ‚Üí number of projects, budgets, statuses, types.
- **Subscription Dashboard** ‚Üí active plan, subscription history, alerts, payment statistics.
- **Content Dashboard** ‚Üí breakdown of series vs films, total episodes, scenes, characters, genres, yearly distribution, budgets.
